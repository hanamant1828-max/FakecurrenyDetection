My fake currency detection project for Indian ₹500 notes is giving incorrect results. The first uploaded image's prediction (real or fake) is being applied to all subsequent images. Please fix this issue and retrain the model properly:

1. RETRAIN THE MODEL FROM SCRATCH:
   - Download or use a Kaggle dataset for Indian ₹500 currency notes (both real and fake)
   - If no dataset exists, use image augmentation to create synthetic training data
   - Ensure balanced dataset: equal number of real and fake ₹500 note images
   - Split data: 80% training, 20% validation
   - Use CNN architecture with Conv2D, MaxPooling, Dropout, and Dense layers
   - Input shape: (224, 224, 3)
   - Output: 2 classes (Real, Fake) with softmax activation
   - Train for at least 20-30 epochs with early stopping
   - Save the trained model as 'rupee_500_model.h5'

2. FIX THE PREDICTION CODE:
   - For EACH image upload, create a completely new prediction:
     a. Read the uploaded image file fresh
     b. Preprocess independently: resize to (224, 224), normalize to [0, 1]
     c. Convert to numpy array and add batch dimension
     d. Call model.predict() on this NEW array
     e. Clear any cached results before displaying new prediction
   - DO NOT store or reuse predictions from previous images
   - Reset all variables after each prediction

3. PREPROCESSING MUST MATCH:
   - Training preprocessing: resize to 224x224, normalize pixels /255.0
   - Prediction preprocessing: EXACTLY the same steps
   - Use the same image format (RGB, not BGR)

4. WEB INTERFACE:
   - Single image upload field
   - "Predict" button that processes only the current uploaded image
   - Display result: "Real ₹500 Note" or "Fake ₹500 Note" with confidence %
   - "Clear/Upload Another" button that resets everything

5. DEBUGGING:
   - Add print statements showing: image shape, preprocessed values, prediction array
   - Log each prediction independently to verify it's not reusing old results
   - Test with alternating real and fake images to ensure correct classification

Please ensure the model is properly trained on ₹500 note dataset before making predictions. If dataset is not available, guide me to download it from Kaggle or Roboflow.
